## üìå Project Overview

The **Hospital Management and Appointment Automation System** centralizes branch, doctor, patient, secretary, and appointment management by providing:

- Branch and doctor assignments
- Patient registration, updates, and deletion
- Secretary login and session management
- Appointment scheduling, approval, and cancellation workflows
- Announcement publishing
- Unique identification control of national ID numbers via triggers

By digitizing daily patient tracking, staff administration, and appointment processes, the system minimizes manual errors and improves service quality.

## üèó System Architecture Layers

1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**
   - Contains SQL Server tables, triggers, and stored procedures.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**
   - Validates user inputs, enforces business rules, and acts as a bridge between the DAL and UI.

3. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Built with Windows Forms or ASP.NET (configurable).
   - Main modules: Branch Management, Doctor Management, Patient Registration, Secretary Dashboard, Appointment Tracking, Announcements.

4. **Deployment & Configuration**
   - Application settings managed via `appsettings.json` or `app.config`.
   - Optional CI/CD integration with PowerShell scripts or Azure DevOps pipelines.
